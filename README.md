# DigitalDisplay


This app serves as the backoffice of an entire digitalisation of the panels which contains announcements.

The entire app is contained of two parts:
1. Backoffice 
2. Consumer

The backoffice part(both frontend and backend) is where you can do the following:

 - Advertisements(the announcements themselves) - you can see(name, type, created date, no. of zones, category), create, duplicate, edit, delete and archive an adevertisement. For the creation, you can either create a text one or an image one;
 - Devices(TVs, monitors etc) - you can see the devices in a table(location, what panel is running on it, last refresh)
 - Panels(what is diplayed on a device) - you can see the panels in a table(layout, number of zones), create, delete, duplicate and edit the panel's name, you can assign/unassign a device to a panel and choose the time when the panel is displayed
 - Panel layouts(the template for a panel) - you can see the panel layouts in a table(number of panels that use this layout, number of zones), create, delete, edit and duplicate
 
After all these actions, the final panels can be visually seen in the consumer app. 

The consumer part is not in this repository.
